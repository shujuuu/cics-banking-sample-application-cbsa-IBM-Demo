# CICS Bank Sample Application (CBSA) React UI User Guide 


## CICS Bank Sample Application React UI Architecture:

For architecture information please refer to the GitHub repo: 

cicsdev/cics-banking-sample-application-cbsa/doc ([here](../../../../doc/CBSA_Architecture_guide.md))

## Accessing the React UI:

Access to the React UI is via a web browser. The exact URL will depend
upon the host name and the port number chosen during installation. It
will look something like this:

[http://*your-allocated-host-name*:*your-port-number*/webui-1.0/](http://your-allocated-host-name:your-port-number/webui-1.0/)

#### CICS Bank Sample Application Main Menu:

The React UI main menu is the start point for utilising all
functionality from this interface. The React UI contains similar
functionality to the BMS offering, however it should be noted that there
is not a 1-1 mapping. 

The React UI contains some functionality which
the BMS offering does not. To utilise a specific function click on the
associated button.

![ReactUI Login](./images/ReactUIUserGuide/002-Carbon-React-User-Userid-And-Password.png)

CBSA as a login mechanism, which is yet to be implemented with any actual security. Any combination of userid and password will take your through to the control pannel.


#### Control Panel

Upon login, the user should be faced with the user functions list, containing both "User Services" and "Accounts Service". This functions are also available from the burger menu in the top left of the screen.

#### Create Account

![Create Customer](./images/ReactUIUserGuide/201-Carbon-React-Create-Customer.png)

A new customer can be created using this view. Note, the expected field format should be present in the boxes before completion. E.g Date of birth should be `dd-mm-yyyy`. If any field is completed incorrectly the account will not be created.

Clicking submit once the form is completed should generate the popup:

![Create Customer Popup](./images/ReactUIUserGuide/202-Carbon-React-Create-Customer-Popup.png)

The customer ID is generated upon creation. 

**Note**: Customers cannot be younger than 18 or older than 120.

#### View / Update Account

![View Customer](./images/ReactUIUserGuide/203-Carbon-React-View-Customer.png)

A customer can be viewed using the CustomerId number or using the account name. Once the submit button is pushed the customer table should appear assuming the customer exists.

Using the update button should produce the update popup:
